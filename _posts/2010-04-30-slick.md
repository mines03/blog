title: facebook chat in windows mobile with slick or jabber
---

As a homo socialis, we need to get socialized in real world or in cyber world. in the last few weeks, <br>
i'm get interested using facebook chat because some of my friends don't have a gtalk, YM, skype or any other chat provider. some of them live in another town or even another country, so it's easy to keep contact with them using fb chat. Using a laptop is nice, but when i hang out, or get traveled, using a cell phone is more practice.So i ask google to find if FB chat is supported by my cell phone.<br>
I found that Facebook has just launched support for Jabber/XMPP, an open protocol that makes it very easy for any chat client or web service to integrate Facebook Chat (it&rsquo;s also the same protocol used by Google Talk). Facebook first announced that it was working on implementing Jabber/XMPP support way back in May 2008, and rumors that XMPP support was on its way began anew in November.<br>
I prefer using slick for my PDA. I use slick v0.55 that's already installed in my PDA more than a month ago. create a new setting this is the setting: <br>
* Protocol : XMPP or Jabber or gtalk if You using slick v.60 or above there is facebook protocol <br>
*username : your facebook application ID( this is not a user name You use to login to your account in the browser). if you don't have one, just go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/username"> https://www.facebook.com/username</a> and get one. <br>
* Domain : chat.facebook.com <br>
* password : <your facebook="" password=""> <br>
* Port : 5222 * Server : chat.facebook.com <br>
* Use SSL/TLS: no * Basic text Authentication : no you're ready to get connected with your friends in Facebook. enjoy!!!!!<br>
